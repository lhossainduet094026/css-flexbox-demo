             <p>Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in poverty reduction, supported by sustained economic growth. It has been among the fastest growing economies in the world over the past decade, thanks to a demographic dividend, strong ready-made garment (RMG) exports, and stable macroeconomic conditions. </p>

          <p>As a result, Bangladesh reached lower-middle-income status in 2015 and is on track to graduate from the UNâ€™s Least Developed Countries (LDC) list in 2026. Poverty declined from 44 percent in 1991 to 15 percent in 2016, based on the international poverty line of $1.90 a day (using 2011 Purchasing Power Parity exchange rate). Moreover, human development outcomes improved along many dimensions.</p>
